EmojiPick PWA (WHITE) v9

This package disables the Service Worker to prevent GitHub Pages stale-cache issues.

Upload all files to your GitHub Pages folder (docs/ or root depending on your setup), overwriting existing files.

After upload:
- Do ONE hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- If you still see old UI, open DevTools > Application > Service Workers > Unregister, then Clear site data.
